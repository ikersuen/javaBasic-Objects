Exception Test:

Q1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
A1. Usage of Exception in Java. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html

Q2. Why the test failed at first?
A2. Because the default output is not the expected test result, some are null and some are empty

Q3. Why you corrected the test that way?
A3.
StackFrameHelper: Use Stacktrace to get the caller method name and class name, concat to get the whole method name
StringFormatException: Use super method to get the caller's thrown exception message
Exception Test: Just filled in the expected result


Q4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
A4. No.

Inheritance Test:

Q1. What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the offical document to the knowledge point?
A1. Learning Java Object inheritance basic concept. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html

Q2. Why the test failed at first?
A2. Because the default output is not the expected test result, some are null and some are empty

Q3. Why you corrected the test that way?
A3.
should_be_derived_from_object_class(): simply get the object class
should_call_super_class_constructor(): goes into util to see what to return by the constructor, which SuperClassWithDefaultConstructor will return log first since DerivedFromSuperClassWithDefaultConstructor inherit it
should_call_super_class_constructor_continued(): check class in util to get result
should_call_super_class_constructor_more(): check class in util to get result
should_call_most_derived_methods(): check class in util to get result
should_call_super_class_methods(): check class in util to get result
should_use_caution_when_dealing_with_array_type(): check class in util to determine throw exception
should_not_make_you_confused(): Still NestedDerivedClassWithName.getName although the Type is DerivedFromBaseClassWithName
should_not_make_you_confused_2(): derived.getName() could be found in the parent class
should_use_instance_of_to_determine_inheritance_relationship(): parent child relationship
should_use_instance_of_only_in_inheritance_relationship(): Should be integer object
Person_For_Equal: Just check equals and return generates hash code, nothing special

A3.
should_point_to_the_same_object(): Same Object
should_point_to_different_object(): different object
should_initialized_to_default_value(): nothing is explicitly initialized, therefore expected to be null or zero
should_pass_by_value(): only pass by value not by reference
should_pass_by_value_continued(): only pass by value not by reference
should_modify_internal_state(): check for the return value for tryingToUpdateState
should_choose_method_at_compile_time(): Check OverloadingFixture for return value
should_choose_the_most_specific_overload(): Check OverloadingFixture for return value
should_calling_another_constructor(): Check CallingAnotherCtor for return value
should_get_initialization_ordering(): Check InitializationOrderClass for return value
should_get_message_of_var_length_parameters(): Check getMessageOfVarLengthParameters for return value
should_get_message_of_var_length_parameters_2(): Check getMessageOfVarLengthParameters for return value
